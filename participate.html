<h2>Mentors</h2>
<p>Are you a web developer, nurse, or environmental scientist? Women currently working in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics oriented career are needed to serve as mentors at Girls Do Hack to help inspire young women to consider a STEM career! Mentors are an essential component of this event as they allow young women to see themselves in the women currently working in STEM careers. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just beginning your career, please consider joining in the fun on Saturday November 14th.</p>

<p>As a mentor you’ll be paired with two students from Chicago area schools. Together you’ll form a team that participates in three hand-on workshops designed to emphasize skills necessary to pursue a STEM career.</p>

<p>Everybody interested in being a Girls Do Hack mentor will be asked to complete the following steps.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete a profile that includes your education and professional background to be shared with event participants</li>
  <li>Complete a background check form, a requirement for all Adler Planetarium volunteers working with minors</li>
  <li>Attend a 60 minute online or in-person mentor orientation</li>
  <li>(Optional) Complete an Adler Planetarium Volunteer Form</li>
</ul>

<h2>Youth Participants</h2>
<p>Are you interested in robotics or discovering a new planet? Would you like to learn more about biology or web design? Girls Do Hack is designed for young women currently enrolled in 9th -11th grade in Chicago area high schools to explore STEM skills you already possess and learn about new ones through a series of fun workshops.</p>

<p>On the day of the event you’ll be paired with another youth participant and a female mentor currently working in a STEM career. Together your team will experience three exciting STEM workshops. <!-- <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/zooniverse.org/forms/d/15DdbgjcNe1DMS3kyAlCXU9bHqmwdgCO_IlzSA27rHm4/viewform">-->Registration opens on 10/1/2015!</a></p> 

<p>Possible workshop topics include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Searching for Undiscovered Planets Outside of Our Solar System</b> - Join the search for planets beyond our Solar System! How do astronomers find planets around distant stars? What kinds of exoplanets have been found so far? You'll uncover the answers to these questions by collecting data from a model star system and exploring a 3D simulation of known exoplanets. You'll then go looking for undiscovered planets using the online citizen science project, <a href="http://www.planethunters.org">Planet Hunters</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Water Quality Wet Lab</b> - Water is important for people and the environment, but all water is not clean and healthy. So, how do we determines the quality of our urban water? In this wet lab we will be completing an observational experiment testing the quality of water samples. You’ll work in small groups to complete the experiments as well as collect and analyze data. Join us for a session that is sure to wet your whistle for STEM!</li>
  <li><b>Mobile Phone App Laboratory</b> - Have you ever wondered how mobile apps are created? Learn how to design, create, and test your very own Android apps using MIT App Inventor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Youth Groups</h2>
<p>Girls Do Hack is designed to give young women the opportunity to explore STEM skills they already possess and learn about new ones through a series of engaging hand-on workshops. Youth participants will be paired with a female STEM professional mentor to learn more about what it takes to pursue an exciting STEM career through a series of hand-on, minds-on workshops.</p>

  <!-- <li><b>Project Z: How to Stay Fashionable During the Zombie Apocalypse</b>  - In the post-Zombie Apocalypse world, humans don’t have many raw materials to work with, and all new clothing and accessories must be fashioned out of old materials. In this Project Runway style wearable tech challenge, participants will be challenged to transform recycled materials into on-trend outfits, perhaps even illuminating them (and keeping the zombies at bay) with the addition of wearable LEDs.</li> -->

<p>The Adler will work with community organizations and Chicago Public Schools to recruit young women currently enrolled in 9th, 10th, and 11th grade who have had limited opportunities with STEM engagement. Limited funding is available to pay for transportation to and from the event organizations and schools that commit to bringing at least 10youth participants. If you represent a CPS high school or Chicago community organization interested in bringing multiple students to Girls Do Hack, please email <a href="mailto:hackdays@adlerplanetarium.org">hackdays@adlerplanetarium.org</a> by <b> October 15th for full consideration. <b> Preference will be given to schools and organizations located in STEM-underesourced neighborhoods.</b></p>
